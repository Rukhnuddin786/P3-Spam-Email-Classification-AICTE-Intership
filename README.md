# P3-Spam-Email-Classification-AICTE-Intership
<p> The Spam Email Classification project aims to identify and classify emails as either Spam or Not Spam using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes various text classification algorithms to analyze the content of emails and categorize them accordingly. It serves as a practical solution for email filtering systems and can be expanded to incorporate more advanced techniques for better accuracy.</p>
<p>Features
Text Preprocessing: Clean and prepare email text data for model training.
Feature Extraction: Convert text data into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF.
Model Selection: Implement various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest).
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for building the machine learning models.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluating models.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization, stemming, etc.
Jupyter Notebook (optional): For interactive development and visualization.</p>
